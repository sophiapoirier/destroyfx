    <h2>Source code</h2>

    Source code is what programmers write to make software like audio plugins! We make the
    source code for all our plugins available, so that you can see how they work, or modify
    them to create new, weirder sounds. Most of the source code is available under the
    <a href="docs/COPYING.html">GNU Public License</a> (GPL), which gives you permission to do
    a lot of things, but also requires your modifications to be made available under the GPL
    as well. Also note that some APIs for interfacing with hosts (like the VST SDK) must be
    downloaded separately from their owners, and aren't as permissive.

  <div class="infobox source">
    <h2>Source code repository</h2>

    The newest version of the source code (and all the history) can be
    found in our <a href="https://github.com/sophiapoirier/destroyfx">Git repository</a>.
    You can also find broken code that might not work yet, and many confusing and unfinished projects!

  <div class="infobox source">
    <h2>Destroy FX Audio Unit utilities library</h2>
    
    We also have a page dedicated to our <a href="dfx-au-utilities.html">Destroy FX Audio Unit
    utilities library</a>, which Audio Unit plugin and host developers may find useful.
  </div>

  <div class="infobox source">
    <h2>Source code packages</h2>

    <p>If you just want the source code for a specific project and don't want to navigate
    our entire repository, we also make source code packages available for each of our
    software releases. You can find a download link in every software info box on our
    main pages.</p>
