    <p>There is a review of the Destroy FX plugins collection (focusing on Buffer Override,
      Geometer, and Rez Synth) in the May 2003 issue of <a href="http://emusician.com/">Electronic Musician</a>
      magazine. It is a lovely review. We got 4 out of 5 goodness points. They even made
      <a href="http://emusician.com/ar/emusic_em_web_clips_8/index.htm">sound clips</a> for the article.</p>
  </div>


  <div class="infobox news" id="2003-02-25">
    <div class="date">February 25th 2003</div>
    <div class="announce">released RMS Buddy 1.1</div>

    <p>The most important improvement in this update is that the RMS values are now correct.
    The prior versions of RMS Buddy did the RMS calculations backwards. Woops. (thank you Hans
    Sj&ouml;blad for pointing out this problem)</p>

    <p>This update also adds a new analysis display field: continual peak (thank you Maan Hamze
    for suggesting that feature)</p>

    <p>
      The Audio Unit version also has some other nice improvements:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The value read-outs are much more reliable and occur on a dependable periodic basis.
      The behavior is consistent between different host apps.</li>
      <li>Because the AU format allows for that reliability, I also added an analysis window
      size parameter that lets you adjust the rate at which calculations occur and get
      displayed.</li>
      <li>Also, the Audio Unit version can process any number of channels, not just stereo. The
      graphical interface adapts to the number of channels being processed.</li>
      <li>The Audio Unit version is also a bit more efficient.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      None of those improvements were possible using the VST plugin format, that's why only the
      Audio Unit version gets them.

    The article includes a statement from Sophia about Audio Units in general and Destroy FX
      Audio Units. I don't think that there's a way to view the article online, but I did find
      <a href="http://www1.keyboards.de/magazine/m0303/303104.html">this link</a> which says something

    <div class="announce">released Buffer Override 2.0</div>
    <div class="announce">released Transverb 1.4, Skidder 1.4, and Rez Synth 1.2</div>

    <p>Scrubby is a brand new effect plugin by Sophia</p>

    <p> Buffer Override 2.0 is major update of Buffer Override.  The main improvements are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>LFOs to modulate the buffer divisor and forced buffer size (thank you Arne Van Petegem for the idea)</li>
      <li>Buffer Interrupt&trade; technologiez</li>
      <li>beautiful new graphics by <a href="http://code404.com/">Justin Maxwell</a></li>
      <li>assignable MIDI control of every parameter</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Rez Synth, Skidder, and Transverb also now feature assignable MIDI control of parameters</p>

    <p>Skidder has a new MIDI note control mode called &quot;MIDI apply&quot; and an option for
    having note velocity control the floor (thank you Sascha Kujawa for the ideas).</p>

    <p>Skidder also has easier to use &quot;range slider&quot; controls for the pulsewidth and
    floor parameters.</p>

    <p>Fixed the denormals problems in Transverb which could sometimes cause CPU spikes while
    processing a silent signal (thank you Christian Bei&szlig;wenger for pointing out that
    problem).</p>

    <p>The dry/wet mix in Buffer Override 2 and Rez Synth is now &quot;even power&quot;.</p>

    <p>Fixed a problem that Transverb, Skidder, and Rez Synth had with updating certain
    displays in response to automation.</p>

    <p>Changed velocity influence in Rez Synth to not be exponentially scaled (because that was
    stupid).</p>

    <p>Rez Synth can utilize MIDI sustain pedal (probably, although I don't have a sustain
    pedal so I haven't actually tested this)</p>

    <p>We have discontinued the &quot;food&quot; plugins for the Mac versions of Rez Synth,
    Skidder, and Buffer Override because they made the plugins incompatible with dual-CPU
    processing mode in Mac OS 9 and they are also unnecessary now that Logic 5 supports routing
    MIDI to VST effects.</p>

    <p>Transverb, Rez Synth, and Skidder all support MIDI program change messages for switching
    between presets</p>

    <p>Transverb has a random "preset" now. Combined with the MIDI program support, this means
    that you can now automate randomization using MIDI program change messages. See the updated
    documentation for more information about that.</p>

    <p>I fixed a few little display bugs in Skidder (there were sometimes wrong displays when
    the host automated certain parameters)</p>

    <p>Skidder's tempo syncing is more compatible with Cubase now.</p>

    <p>Rez Synth handles pitchbend LSB now.</p>

    <p>The fades parameter on Rez Synth has been reversed, which can affect presets or saved
    songs that you have made with Rez Synth.</p>

    <p>The classic Mac OS distributions of Rez Synth and Skidder now include separate versions
    of the plugins in the Logic 4 workarounds folder. This is because I learned that some
    aspects of the workaround that I developed are not compatible with dual-processor Macs, so
    people not using Logic 4 might as well not use those special versions (thank you Carty Fox
    for telling me about this problem). Also, these workarounds are no longer necessary in
    Logic 5. See the updated documentation for more about how to use Rez Synth and Skidder (and
    also MIDI Gater and Buffer Override) in Logic 5.</p>

    <p>all of these plugins now have slightly more complete support of the VST standard</p>

    <p>Transverb now uses highpass filters on the delay heads when their speeds are below 0 in

    <p>The February 2002 issue of Sound On Sound magazine features an article about Destroy FX.

  <div class="infobox news" id="2002-01-19">
    <div class="date">January 19th 2002</div>
    <div class="announce">released Transverb 1.2</div>

    <p>Transverb has a new quality mode that reduces aliasing noise when speeding up delay
    heads past 0. This is the "ultra hi-fi" mode that you can turn on by clicking the quality
    button until you see an exclamation point (!). An X indicates the old hi-fi mode (with no
    protection against aliasing) and an empty box indicates the old "dirt-fi" mode. Note that
    using ultra hi-fi quality will impose an extra processing load as you speed up a delay head
    past 0. You reach the maximum load at about +4 octaves.</p>

    <p>Transverb doesn't "blow out" (i.e. big pop and then silence) from high feedback levels
    nearly as often. It's still possible (that is just the nature of digital feedback), but
    it's a lot harder to do now.</p>

    <p>Fixed a display bug with Transverb's speed parameters where semitone values higher than
    11.5 would be displayed as 0.0.</p>

    <p>Transverb's graphics should open properly in all hosts (particularly an unreleased host
    that may have previously not been able to open the graphics properly).</p>

    <p>Fixed a little something in Transverb that could sometimes cause a crash in old versions
    of Logic for Windows if you switched the plugin to "controls" view.</p>

    <p>Buffer Override now properly responds to the "all notes off" MIDI message. Previously,

    <p>Woops, our first bad bug... There was a problem with the graphics in the last versions
    of Skidder and Rez Synth that could cause crashes when you opened, closed, and then
    reopened their editor windows. The crashes only seemed to happen under Windows, but I've
    updated the Mac versions, too. (thanks for pointing that problem out to me, Mashino Jun)</p>

    <p>I also changed a little something in Skidder that could sometimes cause a crash in old

    Previously this could cause problems for people using things like Pluggo or Max/MSP to
    randomize parameters. (thanks for pointing that problem out to me, Greg Davis)</p>

    <p>Buffer Override now has a "memory" of which MIDI notes are active and also the order in
    which they were played (i.e. which came first, which came after that, etc.). This means
    that if, for example, you play one note, press another note while still holding down the
    first note, and then release the second note, Buffer Override will remember that the first
    note is still active and go back to that note. Previously, Buffer Override only heeded
    notes when they first started. Now you can play quick trills and such and Buffer Override
    will more accurately reproduce what you play.</p>

    <p>Internet links are no longer based on VST parameters. Previously this could cause
    problems for people using things like Pluggo or Max/MSP to randomize parameters. (thanks

    <p>Buffer Override has a new MIDI note control mode called MIDI trigger. In this mode, the
    effect turns on and off when you play notes. This way you can use MIDI notes to not only
    change the buffer divisor, but also to apply the effect only at certain moments. The old
    mode is now called "MIDI nudge." Check the updated documentation for more details about
    MIDI trigger mode. (thank you Sascha Kujawa for suggesting this)</p>

    little VST things and did the same thing with Buffer Food that didn't matter.</p>

    <p>Transverb's speed parameters have been changed and greatly enhanced so that they
    function in a much more musically useful fashion. Check the updated documentation for full
    details (you really ought to if you want to get the most out of Transverb).</p>

    <p>Note that, because the speed parameters work very differently in version 1.1, old
    presets or saved song settings from version 1.0 or 1.0.1 of Transverb will not sound the
    same with version 1.1. But don't worry because there's now a little button in the lower
    right corner that you can press to update your speed parameter settings from the old style
    to the new style.</p>
