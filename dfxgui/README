Tom and I are currently working on making our hyper suped up graphics
library for our Destroy FX plugins.  This new library will be one that
assumes cooperation with DfxPlugin plugins and not any specific plugin
format, so that we can write our GUI code in a way that will work
specifically and nicely with DfxPlugin and will work with all of the
plugin formats that DfxPlugin supports (currently Audio Unit for Mac
and VST for Windows).

For right now, though, we are working on things in a kind of
disconnected way.  Tom is focusing on the VST Windows side of things
and I am focusing on the Audio Unit Mac side of things.  We are both
still learning about some of the platform-specific technical stuff
involved in making plugin graphics.  So for now, I am checking in my
work into this tempory sub-directory called dfxgui_mac.  Everything in
here is just for AU graphics in Mac OS X.  This work is still very
much under development.  Eventually we will better abstract our
platform-specific work and coalesce this all into a unified code base
for our graphics framework.

The work that I have done so far for AU graphics in Mac OS X owes a
great deal to Urs Heckmann's wonderful CAUGui framework.  His code was
the best example code that I could find demonstrating how to use the
Quartz and Carbon Events APIs with AUCarbonViews, and his hard work on
the project and generosity with sharing his code are very much
appreciated.   His excellent plugins are available at http://u-he.com/
and the latest version of his CAUGui framework can be found at
