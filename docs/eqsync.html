<h1 class="title">EQ Sync</h1>


<p class="label">rate:</p>

<p class="desc">
The rate parameter lets you control EQ Sync's rate according to the tempo of your song.  The values are in cycles per beat (note:  I mean per single beat, not per measure, so this is time signature independent).
</p>

<br />


<p class="label">smoothing:</p>

<p class="desc">
The smoothing parameter controls what percentage of each EQ cycle is spent gradually morphing into the next EQ setting.
</p>

<br />


<p class="label">tempo:</p>

<p class="desc">
The tempo parameter is used to tell EQ Sync what the tempo of your song is.  You can alternatively enable the &quot;host sync&quot; option, which means that EQ Sync tries to get the tempo and beat position from the host application.
</p>

<p class="desc">
Please note that &quot;host sync&quot; for tempo only works if the host application supports sending tempo information to plugins.  If &quot;host sync&quot; is enabled and the host supports it, then the tempo parameter's value is ignored (since the host's tempo is being used instead).
