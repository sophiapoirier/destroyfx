This directory has some scripts that we use and find useful in our
plugin making activities.  Some of them are for automating the process
of making distribution archives for our web page downloads and others
do some other useful stuff.


makedist.sh:

This sh script packages up a plugin and related text files
(documentation, license, etc.) into an archive for download at our web
page.


au.sh:

This is an sh script that feeds the makedist.sh script specifically
for the provisional AU builds that Marc makes.  It makes a lot of
assumptions (file names, file locations, etc.) and uses the current
date to generate the output file and in general does stuff that's very
specific to the task, and therefore probably not too useful for anyone
aside from Marc.


fixpng:

fixpng is a simple sh script that will remove gAMA, cHRM, iCCP, and
sRGB chunks from PNG files and also maximize the compression of the
files.  The script uses pngcrush which is available at:
http://pmt.sourceforge.net/pngcrush/
