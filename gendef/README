This is 'gendef', a tool from mingw-w64 that can be used to generate .def files for DLLs.
It is distributed under GPL v3 (the same as destroyfx); see ../COPYING.

Tom imported it here so he can hack it up to understand why VST DLLs
he compiled in 2020 don't seem to load, comparing to known working DLLs.

I modified it to remove all the autoconf stuff and add a simple hand-written makefile for mingw.

It's not part of destroyfx and can be safely deleted if it's not being used.


# - means output to stdout
./gendef.exe ../transverb/win32/dfx-transverb-64.dll


BTW:
x86_64-w64-mingw32-objdump -x file.dll
... looks to be at least as good as this program.
