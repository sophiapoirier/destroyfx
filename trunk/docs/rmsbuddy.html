<p class="intro">
RMS Buddy is a handy tool for tracking RMS and peak volume information.  It gives you separate read-outs for each channel.
</p>

<p class="desc">
The <b>average RMS</b> keeps a cumulative, running average RMS of the audio signal.  It can be reset by pressing its reset button.
</p>

<p class="desc">
The <b>continual RMS</b> is the RMS at the current moment (representing the current snippet of sound, whose duration is controlled by the <b>analysis window size</b>).
</p>

<p class="desc">
<b>Absolute peak</b> displays the highest peak volume level detected so far for each channel.  Pressing its reset button will make it start looking for the highest peak again.
</p>

<p class="desc">
<b>Continual peak</b> displays the highest peak volume level at the current moment (representing the current snippet of sound, whose duration is controlled by the <b>analysis window size</b>).
</p>

<p class="desc">
RMS Buddy performs the analysis calculations periodically.  The size of the period can be controlled by the <b>analysis window size</b> parameter.  This also dictates how often the value displays are refreshed.
