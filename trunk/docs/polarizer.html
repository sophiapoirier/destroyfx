<h1 class="title">Polarizer</h1>


<p class="intro">
Polarizer takes every 1st or 2nd or 3rd or ... (etc.) sample in your audio input and polarizes it.  You can control how many samples are skipped over before one is polarized (the "leap" size) and you can control the strength of the polarization.  You can also implode your audio.
</p>

<p class="intro">
Polarizer is not good for your speakers.  It won't blow them up or anything really dramatic like that, but the audio signals that it produces (especially imploded signals) are not terrifically healthy for your speakers.  I am not responsible for any damage to your equipment because you are, so use Polarizer at your own risk.
