<p>
block test is a pair of VST plugins that do handy things.
</p>

<p>
Both of them will display the current processing block size in their &quot;editor&quot; windows, along with responses to a couple of the more popular hostCanDos.
</p>

<p>
block test effect is a VST effect that, upon construction, writes a file called &quot;VST host info&quot; that logs all of the host's responses to hostCanDos and product inquiries.  During process() and processReplacing(), block test effect will also log all VstTimeInfo for each processing block to a file called &quot;VstTimeInfo log&quot;
</p>

<p>
block test synth is a VST instrument plugin that logs all VstMidiEvents received to a file called &quot;VstMidiEvents log&quot;
</p>

<p>
All of block test's files are written to your desktop folder, or if not there, then somewhere else.
