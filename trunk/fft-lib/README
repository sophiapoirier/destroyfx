This directory contains a public domain FFT routine by Don Cross. I
think I have modified it, but I don't remember how.

FFTW is generally preferable to this library. If you're starting a new
plugin, use that. However, some of my crazy effects in broken-fft
probably rely on particular features of this FFT, so that's why it is
here.
