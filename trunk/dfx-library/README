This is the Destroy FX Library, a collection of useful source code
material for writing audio processing plugins.  Our base library code
is comprised of the dfxplugin and dfxparameter files, plus dfxmidi and
dfxsettings for plugins that use MIDI.  And there is oodles of other
stuff too.

dfxplugin has the base class from which we derive when making
plugins.  The main functions that it serves are (1) making it really easy 
to make a new plugin from scratch and (2) making it really easy 
to support multiple plugin APIs (Audio Unit and VST at the moment).  

dfxparameter has the parameter class with all kinds of fanciness 
that we use in dfxplugins. 

dfxmidi has MIDI handling and related routines.

dfxsettings has routines for storing special plugin settings in 
custom data blocks and also for adding MIDI learn functionality 
for fully MIDI control of all plugin parameters.

dfx-au-utilities has some stuff that's useful for pretty much any AU
plugin or host, so it's in separate files because we possibly also use
that stuff in non-DFX projects.  Also, for that same reason, these
files are an exception in that they are offered under the terms of a
modified BSD License (see bsd-license.txt) rather than the GNU 
General Public License (GPL).

dfxdefines.h a bunch of basic definitions for Destroy FX plugins, and
some base stuff that's just useful all our the source tree.

dfxmath.h has various handy math-related constants and functions.

dfxmutex has an implementation for mutexes that we've used in Geometer.
