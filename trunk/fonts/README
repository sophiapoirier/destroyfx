			a word about our fonts

Some of our plugins' GUIs use special fonts for text display:

	Transverb uses "snoot.org pixel10"
	Scrubby uses "snoot.org pixel10"
	Geometer uses "snoot.org pixel10"
	Polarizer uses "Boring Boron"

Included in this directory are TrueType font files for these fonts.  
The fonts, unlike other things in this repository module, are not
covered by the GPL.  They were made by Tom, though.  These fonts,
along with boatloads of other fonts by Tom, are available at
http://fonts.tom7.com/
