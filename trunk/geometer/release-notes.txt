Wavelab (reasonably) has trouble starting up a plugin with latency
while the song is playing -- the output will have clicks. (In fact, in
Wavelab 3.0 you may get no sound at all because of a bug in that host
that's corrected in Wavelab 4.) Simply restart playing in order to fix
this, or add Geometer when the song is not playing. You may find that
the same thing happens with other hosts as well.

Also, most hosts do not support changing the buffer size while the
sound is playing. In that case, you'll need to restart playing to hear
your changes.

'span' was suggested by Bram of Smartelectronix.
'friends' was suggested by Jason Reed, sort of.
