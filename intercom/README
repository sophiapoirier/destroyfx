Intercom VST Plugin

Part of the Super Destroy FX Plugin Pack
By Sophia Poirier and Tom Murphy 7

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This plugin ruins your music by making it sound like it's being played
through an intercom (in a way).

This plugin works by filling soft parts in the input with noise, so
that the entire clip has approximately the same RMS (volume). The
"special" parameters control random movement of samples, for extra
noise power.
