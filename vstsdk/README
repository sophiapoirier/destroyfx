These files are not part of the repository, because they
are not free software. You can get them for $0, though,
from steinberg's website. This is what they look like.
(You'll want the documentation and the rest of the SDK
if you want to do plugin development, anyway!)

For some plugins, you'll need the headers for VST GUI. You 
can get these from Yvan Grabit's site.
