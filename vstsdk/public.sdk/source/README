This directory should contain a symlink to the directory vst2.x.
This is needed because vstgui wants to include paths like
public.sdk/source/vst2.x/
but the legacy VST2 headers what to include paths like
pluginterfaces/vst2.x/

In this directory, just type:
ln -s ../../pluginterfaces/vst2.x


(The symlink is not added to the repository because allegedly subversion has trouble dealing with this on windows.)
