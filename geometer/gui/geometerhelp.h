  R"(window shape: adjust the fade between windows 
Geometer processes its input in overlapping windows, and  
then fades between them.  This parameter adjusts the  
shape of the fade between windows.  Some effects can  
sound different with different window shapes.)", 
  R"DELIM(window size: adjust the length of processing window
Geometer processes its input in overlapping windows, and 
then fades between them.  This parameter determines the 
window size (in samples).  When running Geometer on live 
input, smaller windows reduce latency.  Bigger windows 
typically result in better quality.  Changes to this parameter 
will not take effect until the audio is stopped and restarted.)DELIM", 
  R"(how to generate landmarks
Geometer works by choosing "landmarks" or "points" on the 
input waveform by various methods.  Click the button to the 
left to choose a method of point generation.  When 
applicable, the slider under this button adjusts some 
parameter of landmark generation.)", 
  R"(how to mess them up
After choosing points, Geometer can mess them up by 
various means.  There are three operation slots, and three 
parameter sliders corresponding to the slots.  Click a slot to 
change what operation is performed, or choose empty to 
perform no operations.)", 
  R"(how to recreate the waveform
Finally Geometer will re-draw a new waveform using the 
landmarks as a guide.  Chose between the various methods 
here, and use the slider above the button to control the 
parameters of the effects.)", 
  R"(midi learn: assign midi controller codes to a parameter
Click the MIDI learn button, and then move one of the 
sliders to make it glow.  The next MIDI controller you change 
will be assigned to this parameter, allowing you to control it 
with your keyboard or MIDI device.  This won't work in all 
hosts.  Check the included documentation for advanced 
functionality and troubleshooting.)", 
  R"DELIM(midi reset: clear a parameter's midi assignment
If you have assigned a MIDI event to a parameter (see the 
"MIDI learn" help for more info), you can use this button 
to erase the assignment.  First you need to activate the 
parameter as a MIDI learner (again, see the "MIDI learn" 
help), then press this button to erase that parameter's 
MIDI assignment.)DELIM",

what is considered 'zero'.)",

Places points at the frequency specified by the slider.)",

Places points randomly on hte waveform.  The number of 
points is controlled by the slider.)",

The larger the magnitude of the current sample, the 
farther away the next sample will be.  The slider controls 
the spanning factor.)", 
  R"(dy/dx: make point when derivative changes by amount
Makes a point whenever the slope changes by some 
threshold.  With the slider > 0.5, this catches sharp rises; 
at less than 0.5, it makes points on sharp falls.  When the 
slider is at 0.5, dy/dx makes a point at all peaks and valleys.)",

Makes a point when the waveform crosses a specific level 
(both above and below the origin).  The slider controls the 
level at which point generation occurs.)DELIM",

Double the number of points.  New points are placed half-
way between old points, with a magnitude determined by 
the slider and the magnitudes of its neighbors.  Note that 
there cannot be more points than samples, so this operation 
may do nothing.)",

Erases every other point.)",

Erases three out of every four points.)",

If a point is not at least a certain distance from the 
previous point, it is removed.  The distance is determined by 
the slider.)",

If a point is more than a certain distance from the previous 
point, its height is set to zero.  The distance is determined 
by the slider.)", 
  R"(slow: lengthen time scale of points
Stretches out the points along the x-axis.  Points towards 
the end of the frame are discarded.  This tends to lower the 
pitch of the sound without changing its speed.)",

Compresses the points along the x-axis.  Points are repeated 
to fill the frame.  This operation tends to raise the pitch of 
the sound without changing its speed.)",

  R"DELIM(polygon: recreate wave with linear interpolation
Recreate the wave by drawing lines directly between the 
points.  Like a lowpass filter, but introduces new high 
frequencies as sharp corners at points.  The slider controls 
how steep the lines are (if greater than zero, they won't 
match up!).)DELIM", 
  R"(wrongygon: linear interpolation in the wrong direction
Like polygon, but the lines are flipped vertically about their 
centers.  Very rough sound.  Like polygon, the slider controls 
how steep the lines are.)", 
  R"(smoothie: smoothly interpolate between points
Recreates the wave using segments of a smooth cosine 
curve.  Much less harsh than polygon or wrongygon.  The 
slider controls the roundness of the curves.)", 
  R"(revisi: reverse segments of the input wave
Reverses the input wave between points.  Can create 
bizarre phasing artifacts.  Experiment with low point 
frequencies and different window sizes for this one.)", 
  R"(pulse: create pulses of specified size at points
Creates a pulse for each point.  The width of the pulse is 
specified by the slider.  Wide pulses that overlap do strange 
stuff; take a look.)", 
  R"(friends: neighboring sections make friends
Stretches the original waveform from a section so that it 
overlaps the next section.  The slider sets the amount of 
overlap.  "Friends" tends to lower the pitch of the input 
without altering its speed.)", 
  R"DELIM(sing: replace the intervals with sine wave
Replaces each segment with one period of a sine wave.  
It's best used with something where landmark generation is 
related to the sound, like dy/dx (especially on percussive 
input).  Combine with longpass for a less harsh sound.  The 
slider makes sing use the sine wave for amplitude modulation 
instead, resulting in a totally different sound.)DELIM", 
  R"(shuffle: mix around intervals
Mixes around the intervals.  Best used with a large window 
size and long intervals.  When this option is selected, the 
slider chooses how far the intervals are shuffled.)",
