DFX Geometer redraws your waveforms in a variety of ways.

The basic idea is to generate landmarks on top of your sound wave,
either at extremities and zero-crossings, or at a specific frequency,
do some operations on those landmarks, and then to do processing based
on those landmarks.

Landmark operations include dithering (remove 1/2 or 1/4 of landmarks),
or artificial doubling (double the amount of points in an arbitrary
way).

One kind of processing is to redraw the wave using straight lines
("polygon"). This induces a strange kind of lowpass and plenty of
aliasing. We can also use straight lines in the wrong direction
("wrongygon") for a harsh sound.
